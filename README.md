Sing and Dance
==============

Sing and dance is a simple mobile for kids up to 3 years. Basically
it show the character picture and the kid clicks to a button to
play the theme music for the character.

It is not available at Google Play store but you can clone this repo
install/deploy this app to your phone. So far I don't have
plan to make this available at Google play.

Motivation:
-----------

My daughter, 2.5y and the available toys for this age. real story: recently we were at
store and my daughter loved a microfone that plays Frozen theme song but it doesn't play the full song
only few seconds and makes my daughter upsaid, as she loves to sing and to dance I decided
to make her own playback with full Frozen theme song pluse some others songs from others
characters that she loves.

Issues:
-------

1. The "Play Music" button, replace the text to play symbol as it is universal
language and easy to be recognized for all kids.
2. The "Play Music" button, once clicked, change color and set disabled for 10 seconds
to avoid double click and stop the music and to have a visual effect improving the accessibility.
